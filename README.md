# BikeAngelsPoint
Integer Programming approach to finding the optimal route to collect Bike Angels points in the CitiBike system. 

Multiple approaches have been attempted at trying to use the large amounts of data generated through a bike-sharing system to try and come up with a method for ensuring the system is sustainable by re-balancing the bike distribution. The problem arises when asymmetric demand can leave certain stations empty and certain stations full thereby preventing users from picking up a bike and dropping off bikes at these locations. Research is often focused on countering this asymmetric demand with trucks to move sets of bikes, and more recently points have been used to affect the behavior of riders to pickup/dropoff at stations to improve the distribution. In this project we take this idea further and see whether it is possible/plausible to redistribute the whole system based on individual users earning money by moving bikes around individually. In order to answer this question we must first figure out what is the most amount of points a rider can achieve in a specific time interval. This is what the method below calculates using a Integer Linear Programming approach.
